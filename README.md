### Building an Interpreter in Go
This repository contains my learning journey through the book "Writing An Interpreter In Go" by Thorsten Ball. 

The project implements a parser and interpreter for the Monkey programming language, a dynamically-typed language with a syntax similar to JavaScript.

I will be adding more and more descriptions and functionalities.
